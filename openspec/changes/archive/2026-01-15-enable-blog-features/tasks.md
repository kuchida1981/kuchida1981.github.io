## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Create `content/posts` directory
- [x] 1.2 Create sample post `content/posts/hello-world.md` with standard frontmatter
- [x] 1.3 Update `config.yml` to add `menu.main` entries for "Blog" (pointing to `/posts/`) and "Archives" (pointing to `/archives/` if desired, or just "Blog")
- [x] 1.4 Verify locally that the blog list is accessible via the menu and the post renders correctly
